Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.
I only made a frontend part of this project using ReactJs, Tailwind, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
